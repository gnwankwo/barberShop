In his experience, George has had the worst wait time when he visited a local barbershop to get a haircut. He particularly remembers a painstakingly long wait for a mere 10-minute appointment. He identifies this problem in the barbershop’s inability to schedule clients for timely appointments, and their non-flexibility in queuing walk-in clients. “Q Me” is an application that opens communication between local barbershops and clients to setup and schedule appointments, queue walk-ins, and visualize their wait time.
